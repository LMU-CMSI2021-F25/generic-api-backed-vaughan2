Used ai for a few things: 
1. Understanding the espn api since there wasn't any actual documentation (endpoints, but especially figuring out what to do with the json that it returns (literally pages)).
2. Overall architecture and planning

4. Figuring out what stuff I was missing (like there should be something to catch errors here, etc)
5. Figuring out a lot of the css
